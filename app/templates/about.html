            <p>Websockets are a technology that provides direct, twoâ€”way communication between the user's browser and the
                server in real time. It is like a constantly open communication line through which data can be freely transmitted
                in both directions without the need to reload the page or constant requests to the server.</p>

            <p>In my project, I created a JavaScript chat client using WebSocket for real-time communication.
                This allows users to exchange messages instantly. The simple interface is made using Bootstrap, and the
                entire chat runs on pure JavaScript.</p>
